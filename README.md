## Overview

This project presents a **Pre-Inspection Vehicle Classification Case Study**, designed for research and learning purposes using a combination of **simulated (Mockaroo) and real-world data samples**. It demonstrates a full **end-to-end data science and machine learning workflow**, from data acquisition and preprocessing to feature engineering, multi-class classification modeling, and performance evaluation.  

The repository provides a hands-on example of applying machine learning to vehicle inspection data, making it suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to understand real-world data workflows and classification challenges.

## Key Features

- **ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) Process:** Collecting, cleaning, and transforming raw vehicle inspection data.  
- **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:** Handling inconsistencies, correcting formats, and preparing the data for analysis.  
- **Data Imputation:** Managing missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Distribution analysis, descriptive statistics, quantiles, and correlation analysis.  
- **Class Analysis:** Examining target variable balance for multi-class classification.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.  
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Training and testing models for multi-class classification.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using multiple metrics to assess model effectiveness.
